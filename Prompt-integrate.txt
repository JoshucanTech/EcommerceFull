1. They only see the final shipping cost for their whole order. 

2. Don't do any of the above. Abstracts everything into a single global shipping speed choice (eg: Standard, Expedited, One-Day, etc.). Unify shipping speeds across vendors Standard/Expedited/etc.
For the buyer, it looks like one choice.

the backend should resolves the buyer’s choice into the correct carrier/service/vendor. (Check if it's already in place first)
 3. The range of the deliveries.

For better clarification:
if vendor A shipping is express 1 -2 day, standard 3 - 4 days, AND vendor B is express 0 - 1 day, standard 3 - 5 days, premier 7 - 10 days, Then what user should see is during selection is:
   express 0 - 2 day, standard 3 - 5 days, premier 7 - 10 days,
Upon selection, they will see what they select, but behind the scene each vendor receives the proper information

If buyer selects Premier (7–10 days)

Vendor B → Premier (7–10 days) is applied.
Vendor A → has no “Premier” option. The App falls back to the closest available shipping speed that vendor supports (usually Standard).

But in the order confirmation, shipments are split and you see the actual per-vendor dates (one might come faster).
Shipment 1 (Vendor A): Standard — Arriving Aug 20–22
Shipment 2 (Vendor B): Premier — Arriving Aug 25–28
